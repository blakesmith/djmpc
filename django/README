My Django directory. These are all the apps I've written for my website
djblithe.com - The blog app, gallery app, and all the templates that go
with it. Other little features on my site such as my chat status,
twitter status and such are mostly integrated into the
templatetags/tag_includes.py under the blog directory. Eventually I'll
move these to be seperate apps that can be merged in easily.
