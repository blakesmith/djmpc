djmpc - An ncurses mpd client with cuesheet support.

REQUIREMENTS
============

- Python 2.5 or greater
- A working version of mpd


INSTALLATION
============

1. Untar the archive by running 'tar xzvf djmpc-$versionnumber.tar.gz'.
2. Run 'python setup.py install' to install the package into your python path.
3. Edit the values in ~/.djmpc/config.py to reflect your setup. 'music_directory' should point to the locally accessible mpd music library. If you're using djmpc with a server that's not located on the client computer, you can specify 'cue_diretory', which is where you can drop all cuesheets for tracks located on the server. Note that the client MUST have local access to the cuesheet files in some way in order to display cuesheet data.
